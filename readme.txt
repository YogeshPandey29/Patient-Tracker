Project Abstract: Due to massive impact of Industry 4.0 almost every industry is undergoing a shift from manual processing to automation of the same. As a result, the health industry is not an exception as far as automation is concerned. The health and medicine manufacturing industries have shown an immense interest in automating their tasks.

This would in turn lead to drastic deterioration of manpower needed to do the same tasks otherwise. Hence, increasing the productivity of the entire staff and improving the quality of service the organisation provides to their customers.

		   Hospital Staff: Clerks/Receptionists, Doctors
		   Inventory Management: Adding/Checking the status of medicines in the stock
