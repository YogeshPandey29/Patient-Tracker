# PATIENT TRACKER

Project Title: Patient Tracker Application



# Abstract

Due to massive impact of Industry 4.0 almost every industry is undergoing a shift from manual processing to automation of the same. As a result, the health industry is not an exception as far as automation is concerned. The health and medicine manufacturing industries have shown an immense interest in automating their tasks.
This is where the PATIENT TRACKER system comes into picture. This software is composed of simple but interactive User Interface which would facilitate various class of staff members of any medical organisation viz. a hospital, and the patients to do more by putting as much less effort as possible.
The staff members would be able to store all the key records of the staff members as well as the patients alike. This would in turn lead to drastic deterioration of manpower needed to do the same tasks otherwise. Hence, increasing the productivity of the entire staff and improving the quality of service the organisation provides to their customers.
